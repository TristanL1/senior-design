    <div class="infoText">
        <p>The Santa Clara University men’s and women’s basketball, and volleyball teams play their contests in Leavey
            Center, one of the finest sports venues of its size on the West Coast. Leavey, who graduated from Santa Clara in
            1922.</p>
        
        <p>Opened in 1975, it was formerly named the Taso Pavilion, well known for its air-supported fabric roof, giving it
            a similar appearance to the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Ind., and the Carrier
            Dome in Syracuse, N.Y.</p>
        
        <p>Ultimately, The Center was originally renovated in 1997, when the sports medicine center, and team rooms for
            volleyball, men’s and women’s basketball, baseball and men’s and women’s soccer, were expanded. A two-year
            reconstruction effort from April 2000 to June 2002 then took place to transform Leavey, which has a capacity of
            4,200, into a one-of-a-kind facility for more than 400 Bronco student-athletes.</p>
        
        <p>Once the 2015-16 season was concluded, the playing surface was removed and a new court, featuring a large stain
            painting of a photograph of Santa Clara University's iconic Mission Church, was unveiled following the
            three-month process. Designed by Tinker Hatfield, Nike's vice president for design and special projects, no
            known playing surface incorporates an image of a campus building in its design.</p>
