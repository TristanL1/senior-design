        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>The Mayer Theatre is a facility for the performing arts that bears the name of Paul L. Mayer, a Santa Clara
            graduate who was a well-known businessman and philanthropist in the Bay Area. Opening in 1977, the theater
            was designed by architect Paul Viemeister to have a modernist design with clear lines and a spacious, open
            interior. Various performing arts events, such as plays, musicals, concerts, and dance performances, are
            held in the theater, which can hold about 800 spectators.</p>

        <p>The Mayer Theatre's stage features cutting-edge lighting and sound systems and a wide projection screen for
            multimedia presentations. The theater also has a complete set of backstage amenities, such as dressing
            rooms, storage spaces, and a green room. The Mayer Theatre not only acts as a performing space but also has
            educational uses. Acting, directing, stagecraft, and stage management are just a few of the theatre-related
            seminars and workshops offered by the university's Department of Theatre and Dance.</p>
