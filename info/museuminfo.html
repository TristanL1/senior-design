        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>The de Saisset Museum is one of three South Bay museums to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.
            The museum, located in the heart of Santa Clara University's campus, was founded in 1955 by a generous
            family bequest. Isabel de Saisset, the youngest child of San Jose merchant Pedro de Saisset and his wife
            Maria Palomares de Saisset, passed away on April 22, 1950. Her will directed that the land be sold and the
            revenues utilized to create and maintain a museum in honor of her oldest brother, Ernest de Saisset, a
            former Santa Clara student.</p>

        <p>Since then, the museum has housed both Isabel's full collection of Ernest's paintings, numbering close to one
            hundred pieces, as well as her collection of de Saisset family antiques, including silver and jewelry. It
            also includes pieces by a variety of Bay Area artists, notably those who are just getting started or are in
            the middle of their careers as well as those who have received less attention or appreciation.</p>

        <p>California Stories from Th√°mien to Santa Clara, a new permanent exhibition that was unveiled to the public in
            January 2020, was envisioned in 2015 by a committee made up of members of the Ohlone community, California
            descendants, and subject matter specialists.</p>
