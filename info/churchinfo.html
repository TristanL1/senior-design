        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>St. Ignatius Church is a Roman Catholic parish church named after St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the
            Jesuits, who established the first Jesuit school in 1548. The 8th of 21 Franciscan missions established by
            Padre Junipero Serra, it was the first to bear the name of a woman, St. Claire of Assisi. The mission
            thrived at first until 1822 during Mexico's secession from the Spanish Empire, when royal funding dried up.
            In 1850, Bishop Joseph Alemany approached a Jesuit priest, Fr. John Nobili, S.J., to turn the parish and its
            lands into a college. From there, Mission Santa Clara became the first college of higher learning in the new
            state of California.</p>

        <p>Constructed in the middle of the 20th century, the
            church was designed by architect Gerald McCue. It has a pronounced bell tower and is organized in a
            modernist manner with simple lines. Large stained glass windows representing scenes from St. Ignatius's life
            decorate the church's open and cheerful interior. The primary place of worship for the Santa Clara
            University community, St. Ignatius Church also functions as a parish church for locals. Daily masses are
            celebrated; on Sundays and holy days, there are additional services. The church also hosts many religious
            occasions throughout the year, such as retreats, conferences, and concerts.</p>

        <p>One of the most notable features of St. Ignatius Church is its pipe organ, which was built in the early 20th
            century and is one of the largest organs on the West Coast. It is regarded as a priceless cultural asset of
            the Santa Clara community and has been utilized in numerous performances and recordings. Overall, St.
            Ignatius Church is an important spiritual and cultural landmark in Santa Clara and a cherished gathering
            place for both the university and the wider community.</p>
