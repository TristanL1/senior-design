        <h1>Welcome to Santa Clara University's AR Interactive Tour Web Application!</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>A little bit about our application: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Why did we choose AR?</b> We believe that AR will give our guests and tourists a fun
                    and interactive way to learn about our campus! Our application allows users to 
                    customize their tour experience by letting them to choose when and where they
                    want to visit. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    To use our application, scan a landmark on SCU's campus (to navigate to one, see our
                    interactive map). When a valid landmark is scanned, you can choose to read more 
                    about the history of the building, what it is currently used for, and famous alumni!
                </li>   
                <li>
                    Some buildings have fun mini quizzes to test your knowledge of our university!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note: Our application will require a stable internet/data connection, in addition
                    to access to your camera and location
                </li>
            </ul>
