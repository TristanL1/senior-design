    <div id="text">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            After clicking the "Start" button either on the home page or here, please allow our app to access your
            device's camera to scan and learn more about the landmarks on our campus. Once you've hit "Allow" for the
            camera permissions, the app displays the feed from the camera, and you can then scan different buildings and
            landmarks on campus. At the bottom of the screen is a section with three buttons. The button with the
            exclamation mark links to a page displaying information about the building and either notable alums related
            to it or hours of availability. The button with the question mark links to a more interactive page about
            learning about the landmark or related alums, which can range from a multiple-choice quiz to a matching game
            to an image carousel. Finally, the button with the map marker links to a map displaying where you are on
            campus and what other buildings are near you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the first two buttons mentioned are "greyed out" until you scan a building and the app recognizes
            it. You'll see that the app recognizes the landmark when the text on the top of the display changes from
            "Point the camera to a building" to the name of the building your device's camera is pointing to. That way,
            you can access these pages according to your nearby landmark.
